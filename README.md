## Getting Started

This project contains 2 applications:
* Server Application
* Client Application

First, run the server application by running the main method of the class TasksServer.java.
Then, run the client application by running the main method of the class TasksClient.java.

Once the client application is running, you can pass commands via command line. The valid commands are described in the class TaskManager.java.

Each command has it's own features.

To stop the client, send an empty command.
